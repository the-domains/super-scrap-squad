description: "If Outerknown's new board shorts ever tear after riding too many waves, you could theoretically recycle them into a new pair. They're from a new line of men's clothing that is made entirely from plastic trash. When the clothes wear out, they can be fully upcycled into a brand-new shirt or jacket."
